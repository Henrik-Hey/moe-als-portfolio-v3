                automotive UI standards.
                <br />
                <br />
                At the same time, shifting priorities meant we couldn&apos;t

                accessibility without compromising quality.

                  Before introducing the final product demo, we needed to adapt
                  the design approach. While the previous mock-ups established a
                  strong foundation, the development team leveraged prebuilt
                  libraries and automation tools from my research to accelerate
                  the build.

                  This shift allowed them to focus on functionality and
                  scalability, resulting in a refined product that differs
                  visually but remains aligned with the original design
                  principles.

              This project was a challenging and exciting journey, from the
              initial ForceGraph concept to the unexpected pivot brought by an
              automotive investor. Adapting to shifting priorities made this one
              of the most rewarding projects Iâ€™ve worked on.

              This project taught me the value of leveraging frameworks,
              libraries, and automation tools to streamline workflows. Moving
              forward, Iâ€™ll continue incorporating these strategies to optimize
              future projects.
